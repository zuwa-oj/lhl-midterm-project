Midterm group project at lighthouse labs

This project was completed by:

## Project/Goals

Project to analyze the World Happiness report data through visualizations in Tableau and statistical modelling to gain insights on the factors that are correlated to happiness across countries.

## Process
Select a topic of interest and get dataset required for analysis.
Create a collaborative project on GitHub that allow upload, download and update of files as both parties work to deliver the project.
Clean up the data using EDA process and did some linear regression manipulation.
Upload clean data to tableau for visualization purpose.

## Results

- The multiple linear regression model suggests that the included independent variables all with p values < 0.05 collectively have a statistically significant influence on the Happiness Score.

- Also, the Adj. R-squared indicating the goodness of fit of the model shows that around 76% of the variability in Happiness Score across countries can be explained by the independent variables.

## Challenges

- Dataset acquired for years after 2019 did not contain Happiness Score so this analysis was only carried out on data from 2015 through 2019.
